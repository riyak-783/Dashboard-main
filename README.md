# Vite + React Dashboard

This project is a dashboard application built using Vite and React. The dashboard provides an interface to create, view, and manage various types of graphs, including PIE, BAR, and RADAR graphs.

## Features

- **Create Multiple Graphs**: Users can create multiple graphs of different types (PIE, BAR, RADAR) by entering the required values.
- **Dynamic Graph Generation**: The dashboard allows you to dynamically generate graphs based on user input.
- **Graph Management**: Users can add as many graphs as needed and delete them through the provided options.
- **Add Widget Options**: The 'Add Widget' feature allows you to select the type of graph, input values, and manage the list of graphs, including deleting existing ones.

## How to Use

1. **Install Dependencies**:
   Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed. Then, run the following command to install the necessary dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Run the Development Server**:
   Start the development server using:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   The application will be available at `http://localhost:5173`.

3. **Creating a Graph**:
   - Navigate to the 'Add Widget' section.
   - Select the type of graph you want to create (PIE, BAR, RADAR).
   - Enter the values required for the graph.
   - The graph will be dynamically generated and displayed on the dashboard.

4. **Managing Graphs**:
   - **Adding Graphs**: You can add multiple graphs by repeating the graph creation process.
   - **Deleting Graphs**: To delete a graph, go to the 'Add Widget' section and select the graph you want to remove from the provided list.

## Project Structure

- **`src/`**: Contains all the React components and application logic.
- **`public/`**: Contains static files like images and the `index.html`.
- **`node_modules/`**: Contains all the installed npm packages.


The output will be in the `dist/` directory.
